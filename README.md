# passenger-counter
Started off by linking my app.js file to my index.html file through the script tag externally. I started to create variables, mainly using the let variable. I set different variables to my first datatype; numbers. 

I was then able to do different mathmatical operations with them such as incrementing the variable using the += operator, reassigning a variable to a different value.

This happened later in the code within the scope of the save() function.

I encountered my second datatype; strings. Using those I built the save feature within the counter, and a few console.log()'s along the way to make sure everything was working properly.

Writing the functions I referenced earlier, save(), increment(), I started to invoke or call them within the html file, using onclick="".

This brought me into the DOM, aka how to use javascript to change the website. I interacted with the DOM in several different ways. First was with the getElementById() and passing in the #id as a string. Next I used innerText to render text, however Googling my way on MDN, found out textContext is actually better solution.
